A test game using a third person controller script with a first person attached camera. The third person camera follows the player and a button press changes the camera view to first person. 

It is very close to the third person controller I hope to  use in future games. I would like to work with the camera follow so a second button or analog stick will be able to rotate around the character and recenter behind the character with a button press.
